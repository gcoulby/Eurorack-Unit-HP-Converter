# Simple Eurorack HP/Unit measurement converter

This project is a simple app for calculating the HP/Eurorack Units to mm/inches.

The primary purpose of the app is to show how many HP slots are required based on the width of circuit boards. For this reason, HP units are always rounded up to ensure the front panel is wider than the build.
